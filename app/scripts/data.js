If one’s not croakin’ from exhaustion, another one’s being crushed under the weight of the coconut! I’ve been through thirty of the things and all I’ve proven is that a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times per second. Ugh. At this rate, Jimmy McGillicuddy’s stupid time-traveling car experiment is going to win for sure. I guess I can kiss Harvard goodbye.", "image": "https://d3gqasl9vmjfd8.cloudfront.net/497ce768-173b-4f23-9e5f-964fe954ff03.png", "price": "12", "reallink": "http://shirt.woot.com/offers/a-simple-question?ref=sh_cnt_top20_1_img"},

Some researchers believe these creatures evolved to become the alchopotamus or fizzards or nogulates or some other beverage-based prehistoric puns. It took a long time, but after many years of growth and change, we can simply gaze outside our own windows and enjoy the current fauna of today.

I remember those years with indisputable clarity, because I am a human and certainly not a robot developed in 2010. For example, who could erase Bull Clumton from their memory? That whole political fiasco dominated the headlines for a given amount of time! Again, this is all fresh in my fleshy human brain because I am a human!
